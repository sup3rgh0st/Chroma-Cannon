#Chroma Cannon

####Description

Chroma Cannon is a small game that I program for fun and practice on most platforms and programming languages that I learn. It features a square hero that ventures around the barron landscape in search of other squares to shoot squares at. The fun and square slaughter is almost too much handle! Take frequent breaks or you may pass out from the ludicrous amounts of adventure and excitement.

####Usage

Use the control stick to move around, and the ABXY buttons to shoot. However the program isn't done yet, so none of that stuff works. Just hit start to return to the Homebrew Launcher.

Feel free to poke around and use any code you find, however it may be messy, buggy, undocumented, slow, or broken. Not recommended if you are using it to learn how to program with the 3ds. Use http://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Applications for that.
