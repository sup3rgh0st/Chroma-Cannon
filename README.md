#Chroma Cannon

####Description

Chroma Cannon is a small game that I program for fun and practice on most platforms and programming languages that I learn. It features a square hero that ventures around the barron landscape in search of other squares to shoot squares at. The fun and square slaughter is almost too much handle! Take frequent breaks or you may pass out from the ludicrous amounts of adventure and excitement.

Official release information can be found here: http://gbatemp.net/threads/release-chroma-cannon-a-colorful-shooting-game.389306/

####How do I play?

Controls are simple. Use the circle pad to move the player around the field, and use the stylus in the direction you wish to shoot. The direction you shoot is determined by where you press the touch screen in relation to the center of the screen. For example, tapping the lower right on the touch screen will let you shoot towards the lower right.

Feel free to poke around and use any code you find, however it may be messy, buggy, undocumented, slow, or broken. Not recommended if you are using it to learn how to program with the 3ds. Use http://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Applications for that.
